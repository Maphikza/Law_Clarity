                            section 45(1), the supervisory body reasonably believes that the business

                            to open any strongroom, safe or other container, in which the

                            reasonable assistance from any person on the premises to use

                            terms of paragraphs (c) to (e). which in the opinion of the inspector
                            may constitute evidence of non-compliance with a provision of this
                            Act or any order, determination or directive made in terms of this
                            Act.

                            (4) The Centre or a supervisory body may recover all expenses necessarily

                            reporting institution or person inspected.
                            (5)(a) Subject to section 36 and paragraph (b), an inspector may not disclose to
                            any person not in the service of the Centre or supervisory body any
                            information obtained in the performance of functions under this Act.
                            (b) An inspector may disclose information—
                            (i) for the purpose of enforcing compliance with this Act or any order,
                            determination or directive made in terms of this Act;
                            (ii) for the purpose of legal proceedings;
                            (iii) when required to do so by a court; or
                            (iv) if the Director or supervisory body is satisfied that it is in the public
                            interest.
                            (6)(a) An inspector appointed by the Director may, in respect of any accountable
                            institution regulated or supervised by a supervisory body in terms of this
                            Act or any other law, conduct an inspection only if a supervisory body
                            failed to conduct an inspection despite any recommendation of the Centre
                            made in terms of section 44(b) or failed to conduct an inspection within the
                            period recommended by the Centre.
                            (b) An inspector of a supervisory body may conduct an inspection, other than
                            a routine inspection in terms of this section, only after consultation with the
                            Centre on that inspection.
                            (c) An inspector appointed by the Director may on the request of a
                            supervisory body accompany and assist an inspector appointed by the
                            head of a supervisory body in conducting an inspection in terms of this
                            section.
                            (7) No warrant is required for the purposes of an inspection in terms of this
                            section.

                            sanction
                            on any accountable institution, reporting institution or other person to
                            whom this Act applies when satisfied on available facts and information
                            that the institution or person—
                            (a) has failed to comply with a provision of this Act or any order,
                            determination or directive made in terms of this Act;

                            the supervisory body must consider the following factors:
                            (a) The nature, duration, seriousness and extent of the relevant non-
                            compliance;
                            (b) whether the institution or person has previously failed to comply
                            with any law;
                            (c) any remedial steps taken by the institution or person to prevent a
                            recurrence of the non-compliance;
                            (d) any steps taken or to be taken against the institution or person
                            by—
                            (i) another supervisory body; or
                            (ii) a voluntary association of which the institution or person is a
                            member; and
                            (e) any other relevant factor, including mitigating factors.
                            (3) The Centre or supervisory body may impose any one or more of the
                            following administrative sanctions:
                            (a) A caution not to repeat the conduct which led to the non-
                            compliance referred to in subsection (1);
                            (b) a reprimand;
                            (c) a directive to take remedial action or to make specific
                            arrangements;
                            (d) the restriction or suspension of certain specified business activities;
                            or
                            (e) a financial penalty not exceeding RI0 million in respect of natural
                            persons and R50 million in respect of any legal person.
                            (4) The Centre or supervisory body may—
                            (a) in addition to the imposition of an administrative sanction, make
                            recommendations to the relevant institution or person in respect of
                            compliance with this Act or any order, determination or directive
                            made in terms of this Act;
                            (b) direct that a financial penalty must be paid by a natural person or
                            persons for whose actions the relevant institution is accountable in
                            law, if that person or persons was or were personally responsible
                            for the non-compliance;
                            (c) suspend any part of an administrative sanction on any condition
                            the Centre or the supervisory body deems appropriate for a period
                            not exceeding five years.
                            (5) Before imposing an administrative sanction, the Centre or supervisory
                            body must give the institution or person reasonable notice in writing—
                            (a) of the nature of the alleged non-compliance:
                            (b) of the intention to impose an administrative sanction;
                            (c) of the amount or particulars of the intended administrative
                            sanction; and
                            (d) that the institution or person may, in writing, within a period
                            specified in the notice, make representations as to why the
                            administrative sanction should not be imposed.
                            (6)(a) After considering any representations and the factors referred to in
                            subsection (2), the Centre, subject to paragraph (c). or supervisory body
                            may impose an administrative sanction the Centre or supervisory body
                            considers appropriate.
                            (b) Upon imposing the administrative sanction the Centre or supervisory body
                            must, in writing, notify the institution or person—
                            (i) of the decision and the reasons therefore; and
                            (ii) of the right to appeal against the decision in accordance with
                            section 45D.
                            (c) The Centre must, prior to taking a decision contemplated in paragraph (a),
                            consult the relevant supervisory body, if applicable.
                            (7)(a) Any financial penalty imposed must be paid into the Criminal Assets
                            Recovery Account established by section 63 of the Prevention Act within
                            the period and in the manner as may be specified in the relevant notice.
                            (b) If the institution or person fails to pay the financial penalty within the
                            specified period and an appeal has not been lodged within the required
                            period, the Centre or supervisory body may forthwith file with the clerk or
                            registrar of a competent court a certified copy of the notice contemplated
                            in subsection (6)(b), and the notice thereupon has the effect of a civil
                            judgment lawfully given in that court in favour of the Centre or supervisory
                            body.
                            (8) An administrative sanction contemplated in this section may not be
                            imposed if the respondent has been charged with a criminal offence in
                            respect of the same set of facts.
                            (9) If a court assesses the penalty to be imposed on a person convicted of an
                            offence in terms of this Act, the court must take into account any
                            administrative sanction imposed under this section in respect of the same
                            set of facts.
                            (10) An administrative sanction imposed in terms of this Act does not constitute
                            a previous conviction as contemplated in Chapter 27 of the Criminal
                            Procedure Act. 1977 (Act No. 51 of 1977).
                            (11) Unless the Director or supervisory body is of the opinion that there are
                            exceptional circumstances present that justify the preservation of the
                            confidentiality of a decision the Director or supervisory body must make
                            public the decision and the nature of any sanction imposed if—
                            (a) an institution or person does not appeal against a decision of the
                            Centre or supervisory body within the required period; or
                            (b) the appeal board confirms the decision of the Centre or
                            supervisory body.</p>

                            she could not prevent the property from being so used,
                            as the case may be.

                            instrument in question, inquire into and determine any such interest.

                            cash or bearer negotiable instrument or property be returned to the
                            applicant or, if the State has disposed of it, direct that the applicant be
                            compensated by the State in an amount equal to the amount of cash or
                            bearer negotiable instrument or the value of the property forfeited; or
                            (b) the applicant had an interest in the cash or bearer negotiable
                            instrument or property in question at the time of the forfeiture, the court
                            must direct that the applicant be compensated by the State in an
                            amount equal to the value of his or her interest in the cash or bearer
                            negotiable instrument or property.
                            (9) Any person aggrieved by a determination made by a court under subsection
                            (8), may appeal against the determination as if it were a conviction by the
                            court making the determination, and such appeal may be heard either
                            separately or jointly with an appeal against the conviction as a result of which
                            the declaration of forfeiture was made, or against a sentence imposed as a
                            result of such conviction.
                            (10) In order to make a declaration of forfeiture or to determine any interest under
                            subsection (8), the court may refer to the evidence and proceedings at the
                            trial or hear such further evidence, either orally or by affidavit, as it may deem
                            fit.
