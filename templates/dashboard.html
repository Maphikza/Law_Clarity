                            section 45(1), the supervisory body reasonably believes that the business

                            the provisions of this Act apply, is conducted.

                            (d) use any computer system or equipment on the premises or require
                            reasonable assistance from any person on the premises to use

                            terms of paragraphs (c) to (e). which in the opinion of the inspector
                            may constitute evidence of non-compliance with a provision of this
                            Act or any order, determination or directive made in terms of this
                            Act.
                            (3) An accountable institution, reporting institution or other person to whom
                            this Act applies, must without delay provide reasonable assistance to an

                            (4) The Centre or a supervisory body may recover all expenses necessarily
                            incurred in conducting an inspection from an accountable institution,
                            reporting institution or person inspected.
                            (5)(a) Subject to section 36 and paragraph (b), an inspector may not disclose to
                            any person not in the service of the Centre or supervisory body any
                            information obtained in the performance of functions under this Act.
                            (b) An inspector may disclose information—
                            (i) for the purpose of enforcing compliance with this Act or any order,
                            determination or directive made in terms of this Act;
                            (ii) for the purpose of legal proceedings;
                            (iii) when required to do so by a court; or
                            (iv) if the Director or supervisory body is satisfied that it is in the public
                            interest.
                            (6)(a) An inspector appointed by the Director may, in respect of any accountable
                            institution regulated or supervised by a supervisory body in terms of this
                            Act or any other law, conduct an inspection only if a supervisory body
                            failed to conduct an inspection despite any recommendation of the Centre
                            made in terms of section 44(b) or failed to conduct an inspection within the
                            period recommended by the Centre.
                            (b) An inspector of a supervisory body may conduct an inspection, other than
                            a routine inspection in terms of this section, only after consultation with the
                            Centre on that inspection.
                            (c) An inspector appointed by the Director may on the request of a
                            supervisory body accompany and assist an inspector appointed by the
                            head of a supervisory body in conducting an inspection in terms of this
                            section.
                            (7) No warrant is required for the purposes of an inspection in terms of this
                            section.

                            (4) The Centre or supervisory body may—
                            (a) in addition to the imposition of an administrative sanction, make
                            recommendations to the relevant institution or person in respect of

                            (a) of the nature of the alleged non-compliance:
                            (b) of the intention to impose an administrative sanction;
                            (c) of the amount or particulars of the intended administrative
                            sanction; and
                            (d) that the institution or person may, in writing, within a period
                            specified in the notice, make representations as to why the
                            administrative sanction should not be imposed.
                            (6)(a) After considering any representations and the factors referred to in
                            subsection (2), the Centre, subject to paragraph (c). or supervisory body
                            may impose an administrative sanction the Centre or supervisory body
                            considers appropriate.
                            (b) Upon imposing the administrative sanction the Centre or supervisory body
                            must, in writing, notify the institution or person—
                            (i) of the decision and the reasons therefore; and
                            (ii) of the right to appeal against the decision in accordance with
                            section 45D.
                            (c) The Centre must, prior to taking a decision contemplated in paragraph (a),
                            consult the relevant supervisory body, if applicable.
                            (7)(a) Any financial penalty imposed must be paid into the Criminal Assets
                            Recovery Account established by section 63 of the Prevention Act within
                            the period and in the manner as may be specified in the relevant notice.
                            (b) If the institution or person fails to pay the financial penalty within the
                            specified period and an appeal has not been lodged within the required
                            period, the Centre or supervisory body may forthwith file with the clerk or
                            registrar of a competent court a certified copy of the notice contemplated
                            in subsection (6)(b), and the notice thereupon has the effect of a civil
                            judgment lawfully given in that court in favour of the Centre or supervisory
                            body.
                            (8) An administrative sanction contemplated in this section may not be
                            imposed if the respondent has been charged with a criminal offence in
                            respect of the same set of facts.
                            (9) If a court assesses the penalty to be imposed on a person convicted of an
                            offence in terms of this Act, the court must take into account any
                            administrative sanction imposed under this section in respect of the same
                            set of facts.
                            (10) An administrative sanction imposed in terms of this Act does not constitute
                            a previous conviction as contemplated in Chapter 27 of the Criminal
                            Procedure Act. 1977 (Act No. 51 of 1977).
                            (11) Unless the Director or supervisory body is of the opinion that there are
                            exceptional circumstances present that justify the preservation of the
                            confidentiality of a decision the Director or supervisory body must make
                            public the decision and the nature of any sanction imposed if—
                            (a) an institution or person does not appeal against a decision of the
                            Centre or supervisory body within the required period; or
                            (b) the appeal board confirms the decision of the Centre or
                            supervisory body.</p>

                            (8) The decision of a majority of the members of the appeal board shall be the

                            matter.
                            (b) The launching of appeal proceedings in terms of paragraph (a) does not

                            point of law relating to any provision of this Act or any order,
                            determination or directive made in terms of this Act.

                            to believe that an institution or person is not complying with this Act or any
                            order, determination or directive made in terms of this Act, it may, if it
                            appears that prejudice has occurred or might occur as a result of such
                            non-compliance, apply to a court having jurisdiction for—
                            (a) an order restraining that institution or person from continuing
                            business pending an application to court by the Centre or
                            supervisory body as contemplated in subsection (2); or
                            (b) any other legal remedy available to the Centre or supervisory
