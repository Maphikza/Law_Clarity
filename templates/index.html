                    responsible, not the person. The third part says that if a business uses
                    somebody else to keep its records, it has to tell the government about it right
                    away.

                impose such reasonable safeguards regarding the furnishing of information
                referred to in subsection (1)(a), (b), (c) or (d) as the Director considers
                appropriate to maintain the confidentiality of that information.

              <p class="paragraphs">(1) Every supervisory body is responsible for supervising and
                enforcing
                compliance with this Act or any order, determination or directive made in
                terms of this Act by all accountable institutions regulated or supervised by it.
                [Substituted by s. 15 of Act 11 of 2008.]
                (1A) (a) The obligation referred to in subsection (1) forms part of the legislative
                mandate of any supervisory body and constitutes a core function of
                that supervisory body.

                supervisory body to supervise or regulate any accountable institution
                must be read as including subsection (1), and a supervisory body may
                utilise any fees or charges it is authorised to impose or collect to defray
                expenditure incurred in performing its obligations under this Act or any
                order, determination or directive made in terms of this Act.
                [Inserted by s. 15 (b) of Act 11 of 2008.]
                (1B) A supervisory body, in meeting its obligation referred to in subsection (1),
                may—
                (a) in addition to any powers it has in terms of another Act, exercise any
                power afforded to it in this Act;
                (b) delegate the exercise of any power contemplated in paragraph (a) to
                any of its members, employees or any other suitable person;
                (c) take any measures it considers necessary or expedient to meet its
                obligations imposed by this Act or any order, determination or directive
                made in terms of this Act, or to achieve the objectives of the Centre or
                this Act;
                (d) require an accountable institution supervised or regulated by it to report
                on that institution's compliance with this Act or any order, determination
                or directive made in terms of this Act in the form, manner and
                timeframes determined by the supervisory body;
                (e) issue or amend any licence, registration, approval or authorisation that
                the supervisory body may issue or grant in accordance with any Act, to
                include the following conditions:
                (i) compliance with this Act; and
                (ii) the continued availability of human, financial, technological and
                other resources to ensure compliance with this Act or any order,
                determination or directive made in terms of this Act; and
                (f) in making a determination in accordance with any Act applicable to it
                as to whether a person is fit and proper to hold office in an accountable
                institution, take into account any involvement, whether directly or
                indirectly, by that person in any non-compliance with this Act or any
                order, determination or directive made in terms of this act, or, prior to
                the commencement of this Act or at any time thereafter, any
                involvement in—
                (i) any money laundering activity; or
                (ii) any terrorist or related activity.
                [Inserted by s. 15 (b) of Act 11 of 2008.]
                (1C) A supervisory body must submit to the Centre, within the prescribed period
                and in the prescribed manner, a written report on any action taken against any
                accountable institution in terms of this Act or any order, determination or
                directive made in terms of this Act.
                [Inserted by s. 15 (b) of Act 11 of 2008.]
                (1D) The Centre and a supervisory body must co-ordinate their approach to
                exercising their powers and performing their functions in terms of this Act to
                ensure the consistent application of the Act, and must enter into a written
                memorandum of understanding in respect thereof.
                [Inserted by s. 15 (b) of Act 11 of 2008.]
                (2) When the Centre refers a matter to a supervisory body or other public body or
                authority in terms of section 44, that supervisory body or other public body or
                authority must investigate the matter and may, after consultation with the
                Centre, take such steps within the scope of its powers as it considers
                appropriate to remedy the matter.
                (3) Should a supervisory body or other public body or authority to which a
                suspected contravention or failure is referred in terms of section 44 fail to take
                adequate steps to ensure that the suspected contravention ceases or the
                suspected failure is rectified, the Centre may, after consultation with the
                supervisory body or other public body or authority concerned, take such steps
                within the scope of its powers as the Centre considers appropriate to remedy
                the matter.</p>

                  <p class="summaries">Every supervisory body is responsible for making sure that
                    accountable institutions obey the law and any orders, determination or directive
                    made in terms of the law. This is a core function of the supervisory body, and
                    any law that establishes or gives power to a supervisory body includes this
                    responsibility. The supervisory body may use any fees it is authorized to
                    collect to pay for the expenses of carrying out this responsibility.

                    In carrying out this responsibility, the supervisory body may delegate the power
                    to any of its members, employees, or any other suitable person. The supervisory
                    body may also take any measures it considers necessary or expedient to meet its
                    obligations or achieve the objectives of the law. This may include requiring an
                    accountable institution to report on its compliance with the law in the form,
                    manner, and timeframes determined by the supervisory body. The supervisory body
                    may also issue or amend any license, registration, approval or authorization
                    given by the supervisory body to include conditions of compliance with the law
                    and the availability of resources to ensure compliance. Furthermore, the
                    supervisory body may take into account any involvement, directly or indirectly,
                    of a person in any non-compliance with the law when making a determination of
                    whether that person is fit and proper to hold office in an accountable
                    institution.

                    If the supervisory body or other public body or authority fails to take adequate
                    steps to stop a suspected contravention or failure, the Centre may, after
                    consulting with the supervisory body or other public body or authority, take
                    steps within its power to remedy the matter.</p>

                other suitable person as an inspector.
                (2) The Director or the head of a supervisory body may determine the

                (3)(a) The Director or the head of a supervisory body must issue an inspector
                contemplated in subsection (1) with a certificate of appointment signed by

                (4)(a) Where the head of a supervisory body is authorised by any other Act to
                appoint inspectors, the head may extend the appointment and functions of
                inspectors under that Act to include the undertaking of inspections under
                this Act.
                (b) An inspector whose appointment or functions have been extended under
                paragraph (a) may, in undertaking inspections under this Act, in addition to
                the functions afforded to such inspector under the Act contemplated in
                paragraph (a), perform the functions afforded in this Act.
                (c) Any extension contemplated in paragraph (a) must be reflected in any

                or
                (ii) is in charge of any premises to be inspected.

                determination or directive made in terms of this Act, an inspector may at
                any reasonable time and on reasonable notice, where appropriate, enter
                and inspect any premises at which the Centre or, when acting in terms of
                section 45(1), the supervisory body reasonably believes that the business
                of an accountable institution, reporting institution or other person to whom
                the provisions of this Act apply, is conducted.
                (2) An inspector, in conducting an inspection, may—
                (a) in writing direct a person to appear for questioning before the
                inspector at a time and place determined by the inspector;
                (b) order any person who has or had any document in his, her or its

                the accountable institution, reporting institution or person—
                (i) to produce that document; or
                (ii) to furnish the inspector at the place and in the manner
                determined by the inspector with information in respect of
                that document;
                (c) open any strongroom, safe or other container, or order any person
                to open any strongroom, safe or other container, in which the
                inspector suspects any document relevant to the inspection is kept;
                (d) use any computer system or equipment on the premises or require
                reasonable assistance from any person on the premises to use
                that computer system to—
                (i) access any data contained in or available to that computer system; and
                (ii) reproduce any document from that data;
                (e) examine or make extracts from or copy any document in the
                possession of an accountable institution, reporting institution or
                person or, against the issue of a receipt, remove that document
                temporarily for that purpose; and
                (f) against the issue of a receipt, seize any document obtained in
                terms of paragraphs (c) to (e). which in the opinion of the inspector
                may constitute evidence of non-compliance with a provision of this
                Act or any order, determination or directive made in terms of this
                Act.
                (3) An accountable institution, reporting institution or other person to whom
                this Act applies, must without delay provide reasonable assistance to an
                inspector acting in terms of subsection (2).
                (4) The Centre or a supervisory body may recover all expenses necessarily
                incurred in conducting an inspection from an accountable institution,
                reporting institution or person inspected.
                (5)(a) Subject to section 36 and paragraph (b), an inspector may not disclose to
                any person not in the service of the Centre or supervisory body any
                information obtained in the performance of functions under this Act.
                (b) An inspector may disclose information—
                (i) for the purpose of enforcing compliance with this Act or any order,
                determination or directive made in terms of this Act;
                (ii) for the purpose of legal proceedings;
                (iii) when required to do so by a court; or
                (iv) if the Director or supervisory body is satisfied that it is in the public
                interest.
                (6)(a) An inspector appointed by the Director may, in respect of any accountable
                institution regulated or supervised by a supervisory body in terms of this
                Act or any other law, conduct an inspection only if a supervisory body
                failed to conduct an inspection despite any recommendation of the Centre
                made in terms of section 44(b) or failed to conduct an inspection within the
                period recommended by the Centre.
                (b) An inspector of a supervisory body may conduct an inspection, other than
                a routine inspection in terms of this section, only after consultation with the
                Centre on that inspection.
                (c) An inspector appointed by the Director may on the request of a
                supervisory body accompany and assist an inspector appointed by the
                head of a supervisory body in conducting an inspection in terms of this
                section.
                (7) No warrant is required for the purposes of an inspection in terms of this
                section.

                that the institution or person—
                (a) has failed to comply with a provision of this Act or any order,
                determination or directive made in terms of this Act;
                (b) has failed to comply with a condition of a licence, registration,

                (d) has failed to comply with a non-financial administrative sanction
                imposed in terms of this section.
                (2) When determining an appropriate administrative sanction, the Centre or
                the supervisory body must consider the following factors:
                (a) The nature, duration, seriousness and extent of the relevant non-
                compliance;
                (b) whether the institution or person has previously failed to comply
                with any law;
                (c) any remedial steps taken by the institution or person to prevent a
                recurrence of the non-compliance;
                (d) any steps taken or to be taken against the institution or person
                by—
                (i) another supervisory body; or
                (ii) a voluntary association of which the institution or person is a
                member; and
                (e) any other relevant factor, including mitigating factors.
                (3) The Centre or supervisory body may impose any one or more of the
                following administrative sanctions:
                (a) A caution not to repeat the conduct which led to the non-

                (c) a directive to take remedial action or to make specific

                or
                (e) a financial penalty not exceeding R10 million in respect of natural
                persons and R50 million in respect of any legal person.
                (4) The Centre or supervisory body may—
                (a) in addition to the imposition of an administrative sanction, make
                recommendations to the relevant institution or person in respect of
                compliance with this Act or any order, determination or directive
                made in terms of this Act;
                (b) direct that a financial penalty must be paid by a natural person or
                persons for whose actions the relevant institution is accountable in
                law, if that person or persons was or were personally responsible
                for the non-compliance;
                (c) suspend any part of an administrative sanction on any condition
                the Centre or the supervisory body deems appropriate for a period
                not exceeding five years.
                (5) Before imposing an administrative sanction, the Centre or supervisory
                body must give the institution or person reasonable notice in writing—
                (a) of the nature of the alleged non-compliance:
                (b) of the intention to impose an administrative sanction;
                (c) of the amount or particulars of the intended administrative
                sanction; and
                (d) that the institution or person may, in writing, within a period
                specified in the notice, make representations as to why the
                administrative sanction should not be imposed.
                (6)(a) After considering any representations and the factors referred to in
                subsection (2), the Centre, subject to paragraph (c). or supervisory body
                may impose an administrative sanction the Centre or supervisory body
                considers appropriate.
                (b) Upon imposing the administrative sanction the Centre or supervisory body
                must, in writing, notify the institution or person—
                (i) of the decision and the reasons therefore; and
                (ii) of the right to appeal against the decision in accordance with
                section 45D.
                (c) The Centre must, prior to taking a decision contemplated in paragraph (a),
                consult the relevant supervisory body, if applicable.
                (7)(a) Any financial penalty imposed must be paid into the Criminal Assets
                Recovery Account established by section 63 of the Prevention Act within
                the period and in the manner as may be specified in the relevant notice.
                (b) If the institution or person fails to pay the financial penalty within the
                specified period and an appeal has not been lodged within the required
                period, the Centre or supervisory body may forthwith file with the clerk or
                registrar of a competent court a certified copy of the notice contemplated
                in subsection (6)(b), and the notice thereupon has the effect of a civil
                judgment lawfully given in that court in favour of the Centre or supervisory
                body.
                (8) An administrative sanction contemplated in this section may not be
                imposed if the respondent has been charged with a criminal offence in
                respect of the same set of facts.
                (9) If a court assesses the penalty to be imposed on a person convicted of an
                offence in terms of this Act, the court must take into account any
                administrative sanction imposed under this section in respect of the same
                set of facts.
                (10) An administrative sanction imposed in terms of this Act does not constitute
                a previous conviction as contemplated in Chapter 27 of the Criminal
                Procedure Act. 1977 (Act No. 51 of 1977).
                (11) Unless the Director or supervisory body is of the opinion that there are
                exceptional circumstances present that justify the preservation of the
                confidentiality of a decision the Director or supervisory body must make
                public the decision and the nature of any sanction imposed if—
                (a) an institution or person does not appeal against a decision of the
                Centre or supervisory body within the required period; or
                (b) the appeal board confirms the decision of the Centre or
                supervisory body.</p>

                (4) Whenever any person is convicted of an offence under section 54 the court
                convicting that person must, in addition to any punishment which that court
                may impose in respect of the offence, declare any cash or bearer negotiable

                may impose in respect of the offence, declare any property in respect of which
                those transactions were conducted to be forfeited to the State.

                than the convicted person may have in the cash or bearer negotiable
                instrument or property concerned if that person proves—

                she could not prevent the property from being so used,
                as the case may be.
                (7) Subject to subsection (6), the court concerned or, if the judge or judicial officer
                concerned is not available, any judge or judicial officer of that court, may at
                any time within a period of three years from the date of the declaration of

                who claims that he or she has any interest in the cash or bearer negotiable
                instrument in question, inquire into and determine any such interest.
                (8) Subject to subsection (6), if a court referred to in subsection (7) finds that—
                (a) the cash or bearer negotiable instrument or property in question
                belonged to the applicant at the time of the forfeiture, the court must
                set aside the declaration of forfeiture in question and direct that the
                cash or bearer negotiable instrument or property be returned to the
                applicant or, if the State has disposed of it, direct that the applicant be
                compensated by the State in an amount equal to the amount of cash or
                bearer negotiable instrument or the value of the property forfeited; or
                (b) the applicant had an interest in the cash or bearer negotiable
                instrument or property in question at the time of the forfeiture, the court
                must direct that the applicant be compensated by the State in an
                amount equal to the value of his or her interest in the cash or bearer
                negotiable instrument or property.
                (9) Any person aggrieved by a determination made by a court under subsection
                (8), may appeal against the determination as if it were a conviction by the
                court making the determination, and such appeal may be heard either
                separately or jointly with an appeal against the conviction as a result of which
                the declaration of forfeiture was made, or against a sentence imposed as a
                result of such conviction.
                (10) In order to make a declaration of forfeiture or to determine any interest under
                subsection (8), the court may refer to the evidence and proceedings at the
                trial or hear such further evidence, either orally or by affidavit, as it may deem
                fit.

                    search your belongings or container if they have reasonable grounds to believe
                    that an offence has been, or is about to be committed. They can also seize any
                    cash or bearer negotiable instrument that they find. Anything that is seized
                    must be returned as soon as possible, unless the person has been arrested or a
                    summons has been issued, in which case it can be kept for 90 days. If the person
                    is acquitted or there is no forfeiture order, the belongings must be returned.If
                    someone is convicted of an offence, the court can declare any cash or property
                    that was seized, or is in the possession of the convicted person, to be
                    forfeited to the state. This doesn't affect any interest that other people may
                    have in the cash or property, as long as they can prove that they acquired the
                    interest in good faith and didn't know that the cash or property was going to be
                    used for the offence.If you are unhappy with a decision made by the court under
                    section 8, you can appeal against the decision as if it were a conviction by the
                    court. This means that you can either have the appeal heard separately or at the
                    same time as an appeal against the conviction that led to the declaration of

                as the case
                may be.

                (3) The following jurisdictional provisions apply to the Ombud in respect of the

                (ii) Where the complainant was unaware of the occurrence of the act or omission
                contemplated
                in subparagraph (i) , the period of three years commences on the date on which the
                complainant became aware or ought reasonably to have become aware of such
                occurrence , whichever occurs first.

                (b)

                complaint
                be dealt with by a Court or through any other available dispute resolution process , and
                decline to
                entertain the complaint.

                (4) The Ombud must not proceed to investigate a complaint officially received , unless
                the Ombud -

                to the
                parties, requiring them to confirm whether or not they accept the recommendation and ,

                of investments held in its name and reflected in the client records of the FSP, and the number of
                investments reflected in the records of the collective investment scheme or company, takes
                place on an ongoing basis;

                (b) such procedures are followed by the FS P;

                (3) The independent nom inee must maintain fidelity guarantee and professional indemnity insurance
                sufficient to cover the risk of losses due to fraud, dishonesty and negligence that can reasonably be
                expected in an organisation of the size and complexity of the nominee and with due regard to the
                relationship with the administrative FSP concerned.

                (4)
                (a) Where an administrative FSP ceases to conduct business or its authorisation as a financial
                services provider lapses or is withdrawn, or its business is wound up or liquidated, t he
                independent nominee of the FSP must with regard to investments, transfer the investments out
                of the bulk account of the independent nominee held with the relevant product supplier, into an
                account held in the name of a client concerned with that product supplier or the independent
                nominee of another administrative FSP: Provided that where the client is a long -term insurer as
                defined in section 1(1) of the Long -term Insurance Act, 1998 (Act No. 52 of 1998), or a pension
                fund organisation as defined in sec tion 1(1) of the Pension Funds Act, 1956 (Act No. 24 of 1956),
                the transfer of the investments will be subject to the contract with the relevant insurer
                and the Long -term Insurance Act, 1998, or the rules of the relevant pension fund organisation
                and the P ension Funds Act, 1956, as the case may be.

                (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) apply with the necessary changes where the mandate of an
                administrative FSP is terminated, in which case the FSP must ensure that instructions by clients
                concerned for the tra nsfers are carried out.

                11. Enforcing court orders

                The provisions of section 4(4)(b) of the Act apply with the necessary changes to any nominee

                available to the registrar that prejudice contemplated in that section has occurred or may occur.

                12. Construction of certain references

                A reference in any law or document to an independent custodian, an investment manager or a linked
                investment services provider (LISP) must, unless clearly inappropriate or inconsistent with a provision
                of the Act, be construed as a reference to an independent nominee, a discretionary FSP and an
                administrative FSP, respectively.

                provisions of th is

                during
                the period of suspension, issue any fresh participatory interests, but must, in respect of participatory
                interests issued, continue the administration of the collective investment scheme and deal with such
                interests in all respects as it would have been bound to do had its registration not been suspended.</p>
